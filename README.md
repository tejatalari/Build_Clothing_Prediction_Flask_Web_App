## Project Overview

This project is focused on classifying different types of clothing items using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify images of clothing into categories such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), which contains 60,000 grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories for training and 10,000 images for testing.

### Dataset Structure

- **Classes**:
  1. T-shirt/top
  2. Trouser
  3. Pullover
  4. Dress
  5. Coat
  6. Sandal
  7. Shirt
  8. Sneaker
  9. Bag
  10. Ankle boot

- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels

## Model Architecture

The model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify images of clothing into the respective categories.

### Key Components

- **Input Layer**: Accepts 28x28 pixel grayscale images.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the input images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
- **Dense Layers**: Classify the extracted features into clothing categories.
- **Softmax Activation**: Used in the final layer to output probabilities for each class.

### Model Summary

- **Conv2D**: 32 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation
- **MaxPooling2D**: Pool size 2x2
- **Conv2D**: 64 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation
- **MaxPooling2D**: Pool size 2x2
- **Flatten Layer**
- **Dense Layer**: 128 units, ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: 10 units, Softmax activation

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/clothing-classification-cnn.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd clothing-classification-cnn
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Train the Model**:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
2. **Evaluate the Model**:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```
3. **Predict on New Data**:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --image path/to/image.png
    ```

## Results

The model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

- **Accuracy**: 92%
- **Precision**: 90%
- **Recall**: 91%
- **F1-Score**: 90%

### Sample Predictions

- Image 1: T-shirt (Prediction: T-shirt, Confidence: 95%)
- Image 2: Sneaker (Prediction: Sneaker, Confidence: 93%)

## Future Work

- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply advanced augmentation techniques to increase the robustness of the model.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web application for real-time clothing classification.
